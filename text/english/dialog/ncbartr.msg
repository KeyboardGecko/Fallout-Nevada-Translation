{100}{}{You see Myers.}
{101}{}{You see the head of the restaurant. He smiles, even though he's very busy.}

#Оружие в руках
{102}{}{Hey, while you're in here, the weapon stays in holster.}
{103}{}{I know we say the customer with a knife is always right... But there's a limit!}

#This next one is bugged, waiting for a fix
#{104}{}{I have a feeling like I'm being watched... [he shakes his head] It's all in my head, probably.}

{110}{}{One sandwich and beer...}
{111}{}{Who ordered a gecko steak?}
{112}{}{Forty-five bucks.}
{113}{}{You want a take-away?}
{114}{}{Special order from Avellone on the way...}
{115}{}{No, no tabs.}
{116}{}{One "dive bomb" with ice, coming right up.}
{117}{}{Keep it down, this ain't a casino!}
{118}{}{Who didn't pay for his sandwich?!}
{119}{}{Still waiting on that order of brahmin meat...}
{120}{}{[Whistles]}

{130}{}{Are you interested in gecko eggs?}
{131}{}{Hell yeah! It's a delicacy around here. I'll pay you }
{132}{}{ bucks for each!}
{133}{}{Do you have regular suppliers?}
{134}{}{Nah. Sometimes the hunters bring these eggs in from the north and northeast, but more often caravans buy 'em there, then sell 'em here at a profit. Hunters get money, caravans get money, and once I'm done with 'em, I get money. Everybody wins.}
{135}{}{I'll sell all the eggs I have.}
{136}{}{}
{137}{}{I'll think about it.}
{138}{}{Thanks! Here's your money.}
{139}{}{You're welcome.}

{140}{}{Okay. Where are the eggs?}
{141}{}{Uh, just a second...}
{142}{}{What? You're practically robbing me! Can I get another 10 dollars each?}
{143}{}{}
{144}{}{That'd be robbing *me!* No deal!}
{145}{}{Fine, I'll sell them at your price.}
{146}{}{Then I'll take my eggs elsewhere.}
{147}{}{[He frowns and grumbles] These eggs have been hard to get lately, so... Fine. Another ten bucks. My customers will have to put up with higher prices.}

{149}{}{[He glares at you] Are you going to order something?}
{150}{}{Hey, you hungry? Want something?}
{151}{}{Yes?}
{152}{}{Show me the menu.}
{153}{}{}
{154}{}{Thanks, that's all.}

{155}{}{Shit! [He recoils] Look, I'll cook you whatever you want, but after that you have to get out. And... Just don't touch anything!}
{156}{}{Mrs. Clover told me what you did for her. Look, any friend of the community's a friend of mine. Next time you're in here, it's 5% off on me.}
{157}{}{You? It's you! Please, ma'am, sit down, sit down! What can I do for you? And don't worry about payment - I'm just happy to have you here.}
{158}{}{Hey, thanks for stopping by! The whole town's talking about you, you know. For you, I'm cutting the prices by a quarter. What goes around, comes around, am I right?}
{159}{}{Oh, uh, hey! You're the talk of the town. Just so you'd know, I had to, uh, raise my prices by 25%. Nothing to do with you, of course... Just business.}
{160}{}{You? It's you! Please, sir, sit down, sit down! What can I do for you? And don't worry about payment - I'm just happy to have you here.}
{161}{}{You have received a discount in the restaurant.}

{170}{}{Who's that little urchin running around?}
{171}{}{Billy? I picked him up on the street to mop floors and clean tables. Don't worry about him, he's happy as long as he's fed. So, what would you like to eat?}

{172}{}{Anything else?}
{173}{}{}

{174}{}{Do you know the girl on this photo?}
{175}{}{Maybe... She looks familiar. Wait, of course! She lived across the street from the restaurant, 75 Virginia Street. Ask around in the slums, they can probably help you.}

{176}{}{Please, help... I'm so hungry...}
{177}{}{No handouts. Show me some money or get out.}

{178}{}{Please... I'm dying... I need food...}
{179}{}{And I need to pay the rent! I'm running business here, I can't just give away food. Sorry.}
{180}{}{[He sighs] Fine, here's *one* sandwich. Now get out! You're disturbing my customers.}

{181}{}{Do bikers come by here?}
{182}{}{Not since that thing with the stagecoach. They used to come to the city before, but even then they were not very welcomed here.}
{183}{}{What's the story with the stagecoach?}
{184}{}{Haven't you heard? They hit one of the "Nevada Express" transports, the stupid bastards. When the "Express" guys find out where they're hiding, they'll feed them their own ass. Good riddance, I say - they've been nothing but trouble every time I've seen 'em.}

{185}{}{Wow, you've got a whole mountain of meat on the street!}
{186}{}{Yeah, I managed to cut a deal with Mr. Luciano. He's got the best meat in the city... Most expensive, too. [he frowns]}
{187}{}{The best? How do you know?}
{188}{}{Mr. Luciano's always on time with deliveries, and his brahmin are always healthy. Many of the small farmers I worked with were much less reliable, but I never had a problem with Luciano's products.}
{189}{}{Right.}

{190}{}{How long has it been since Mr. Mordino visited you?}
{191}{}{[He stops what he's doing, then peers at you with narrowed eyes] Long. And it better be a long time before you ask me that again. Mordino's business is his own. I won't say anything about it.}
{192}{}{And who will?}
{193}{}{Look. [he points one finger towards you] My lips are sealed, you get that? You really want to find out? Go ask someone else, somewhere else. You get me?}
{194}{}{Yeah, I get you.}

{300}{}{Hey, you want a steady supply of Nuka-Cola? Why not set up a contract with Salt Lake!}

{301}{}{[He looks you up and down] Are you the one offering the contract? Sorry, I don't even know you. I can't trust my customers' health to you!}
{302}{}{That's a shame...}
{303}{}{Do you really work for the Nuka-Cola factory? You don't look like the type.}
{304}{}{You don't believe me? Just look at my license!}
{305}{}{What's that supposed to mean? Oh, forget it.}

{306}{}{Uh-huh. [he crosses his arms] How do I know you didn't steal it? Thanks, but no thanks.}
{307}{}{That was rude.}
{308}{}{I'll find a way to gain your trust.}

{309}{}{Nuka-Cola? Hmm. Maybe. It depends on the price.}
{310}{}{The price is reasonable - I work directly with the Nuka-Cola factory.}
{311}{}{You still don't strike me as the business type, but hey, who am I to argue? What's it gonna cost me?}

{312}{}{Oh yeah? Who's going to transport it?}
{313}{}{Why does that matter?}

{314}{}{This kind of stuff should be delivered by a caravan, usually by a lot of them. That means I've got to cut more deals and spend more money. I can't pay so much for a product that costs a few bucks to people, you know?}
{315}{}{Don't worry about the delivery. That's my problem. All you have to do is to sell it.}
{316}{}{Hmm... I'll think about it and come back with a solution.}

{317}{}{Well, if you can deal with all that yourself, then I'm in. Why not?}
{318}{}{So we have a deal?}
{319}{}{Sure. I'll fix one of those drink machines and put it there. You'll be able to automatically calculate and pick up your share of the profits right there. You'll just have to make sure the product gets here and collect your money.}
{320}{}{Then let's get to work!}

{321}{}{Great! A deal's a deal!}
{322}{}{Let's do this...}

{323}{}{Great! Thanks!}
{324}{}{See you.}
