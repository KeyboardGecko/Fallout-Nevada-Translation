{100}{}{You see Jay.}
{101}{}{You see Jay Nilsson, a black street dweller. People call him "Potato foot".}
{102}{}{Hey, let's show these crackers some rhythm!}
{103}{}{I'm gonna miss your vocals.}

{110}{}{[At first it looks like a pile of garbage has come to life. Then someone's dirty foot emerges from the trash, followed by an equally dirty face with wild black hair. The figure pulls out some massive metal cans, arranges them around him and sits down.]}
{111}{}{Uh, what are you doing?}
{112}{}{Huh? I'm going to play. Sit back and listen.}
{113}{}{Are you serious?}
{114}{}{Damn right! You see? [he takes out two chipped, mismatched sticks] Drum sticks. I found them in the trash. Want me to play something?}
{115}{}{Okay, I'm curious.}

{116}{}{Hey, no. [he raises his hand] Not on an empty stomach.}
{117}{}{Here's ten dollars.}
{118}{}{What?! You want me to feed you so you could bang on some cans?}
{119}{}{Sorry, I've got nothing.}

{120}{}{Respect! Alright, we're cracking. One, two, three, four... Let's go! [he starts skillfully banging out a melody on the cans]}
{121}{}{Whoa, my ears! That's not music, that's noise! Knock that off!}
{122}{}{I can feel the rhythm! Keep it up!}
{123}{}{I don't know if that was worth it. I'm just going to go now.}

{124}{}{[Jay continues to practice on his "drums".]}
{125}{}{How long have you been doing this?}
{126}{}{I won't bother you.}
{127}{}{Since childhood. I give people a show, make a few bucks, live another day.}
{128}{}{You know, you're way too good to be playing on trash cans. I'm putting together a band for the local club. Interested?}
{129}{}{A band?! Wow! Sure! I'll go there right now!}
{130}{}{Go on, then.}

{131}{}{I'll play you a few tunes if you get me something to eat. I'm starving here.}
