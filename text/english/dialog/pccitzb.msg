{100}{}{You see Dante.}
{101}{}{You see a young inhabitant of Bridgeport. Although he tries to imitate the bikers, he still looks like a farmer.}
{102}{}{}
{103}{}{Wanna fight? I'll show you!... I mean, WE will show you!}
{104}{}{Damn! They left! WITHOUT ME! And I had such high hopes...}
{105}{}{They're all dead... But... How? I thought, they were the toughest!}
{106}{}{I'm staying. Perhaps, I will have to leave some day. But for now - I'm staying.}

{110}{}{}
{111}{}{Hello.}
{112}{}{Who are you? You're not a biker, right? If not, then we have nothing to talk about. And tell my dad that I'm a part of the gang now.}
{113}{}{You're tired of being a farmer?}
{114}{}{That's right! I've always hated this shithole. The fuck?! I can do better than that! Let my parents dig the dirt if they want, but I want to be free.}
{115}{}{[Next]}
{116}{}{These bikers have been my idols ever since they first got here. They know so many things, they've seen so much! When I join their ranks, it'll be awesome!.}
{117}{}{Okay. Well, good luck to you.}
{118}{}{You again? Don't mess with me, I'll become a BIKER soon! Yeah!}
{119}{}{Right, whatever you say.}

{120}{}{Would your parents agree with that?}
{121}{}{What do you know about the bikers?}
{122}{}{How are you going to join bikers?}
{123}{}{Of course they would. But I won't ask them. Living here is boring. I want to be with the bikers.}
{124}{}{They will test me. It probably won't be easy.}
{125}{}{Not easy? But you're confident right?}
{126}{}{Yes... Damn it, I'm willing to die trying! Listen, Can you help me? There are two challenges I have to complete, and I may not be up to it. First is shooting a pistol. I don't even have one, not to mention shooting skills. The second one is a fistfight. The chief said that no one's gonna beat me to death, I just have to stay on my feet while I'm being beaten. How will I get through the pain? This is no game.}
{127}{}{Fine, I'll help you. It seems you have no choice other than to join the bikers. Okay, I will get you a pistol and some painkillers.}
{128}{}{I won't help you.}
{129}{}{Then get the fuck out of here! [hysterically] I'll manage without you! I can... I'm a man... I'm a man... [It seems this guy desperately wants to join the bikers.]}
{130}{}{[Leave]}
{131}{}{You will? Awesome. Just hurry before they leave. Otherwise I will be left behind, and I will have to wait until the next time they come.}
{132}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Especially if I had some personal incentive.}
{133}{}{Hi. Do you remember your promise to help me? Hurry the bikers could leave at any moment.}
{134}{}{[He slaps his forehead] How could I! Of course! I know a place where my dad keeps his cash. I don't know how much money there is. To be honest, I never asked - because I didn't need any money in this shithole. If you help me, I'll tell you where the stash is.}
{135}{}{Great.}
{136}{}{I made my decision - I want to join the gang. The rest doesn't matter. Where they live, what they eat - what's the difference? What's more important, they don't belong to anyone and they do whatever they feel is right. Now that's a life!}
{137}{}{Hello.}

{140}{}{Let's talk about you joining the gang.}
{141}{}{They want to give me some tests. There are a few, but I'm only worried about two. First is shooting a pistol. Second is a fistfight. The chief said that no one's gonna beat me to death, I just have to stay on my feet while I'm being beaten.}
{142}{}{This pistol will be just right for your test [give }
{143}{}{].}
{144}{}{Take a painkiller.}
{145}{}{Take a painkiller from this kit.}
{146}{}{Take a painkiller from this doctor bag.}
{147}{}{Take this gun [give him a 10mm pistol].}
{148}{}{Take this gun [give him a 10mm pistol with ext. mag].}
{149}{}{Take this gun [give him a 10mm pistol model ยน80].}
{150}{}{Take this gun [give him a 10mm pistol with a flashlight].}
{151}{}{Take this gun [give him a premium 10mm pistol].}
{152}{}{I can't help right now.}

{153}{}{Wow! A real gun? Superb! Now I have to learn how to use it. Can you teach me?}
{154}{}{Sure, I have enough experience to teach you.}
{155}{}{Honestly, my shooting skills are below average. You'll have to do it without me.}
{156}{}{No. You have the pistol, teach yourself.}
{157}{}{Fine, I'll ask that old prospector from the farm house. He shoots good and probably won't tell my dad about it. Thanks for the help.}
{158}{}{You're welcome.}
{159}{}{[You set up a shooting range outside the town and teach the boy the basics of shooting. He is a quick learner.] Awesome! Thanks for the help. Just don't tell my dad, he'll lock me up and won't let me out until the bikers are gone.}
{160}{}{Fine.}
{161}{}{Will this help with the pain? Great, just what I need! Thanks.}
{162}{}{You're welcome.}
{163}{}{Now I'm ready! I'll have to practice a little and then go to the chief. Thank you, this day will change my life you understand? Now, about that stash I promised to tell you about...}
{164}{}{Yes, tell me.}

{165}{}{Your father does not want you to go with bikers.}
{166}{}{I don't need his permission. Living in a hole like Bridgeport is not for me. I'm better off with the bikers.}
{167}{}{I don't wanna know about it. I wouldn't steal from a farmer. Let's just leave that stash a secret.}
{168}{}{Okay, it's in the bathroom under the tub. You just have to take the planks off the floor.}
{169}{}{Under the tub? Great, I will check it out.}
{170}{}{If you wanted to impress me, I'm not. Fine, if you don't want it, I'm not going to make you.}
{171}{}{Good.}

{172}{}{You're making a mistake. You have a home and a family that needs you. The bikers are just a bunch of strangers.}
{173}{}{So? I'm sick of this place. You're telling me to just stay here? I'd rather die!}
{174}{}{Look at yourself. You are nothing like the bikers. Even if you pass all the tests, you won't be able to live like they do. Eventually, you'll just become a burden to them. Think about your family - not many have the luxury to live in a place like this.}
{175}{}{Looks like I can't change your mind. Maybe I'll try some other time. Bye.}
{176}{}{I didn't think about that... I thought I would learn everything in my time. But you're right - am I like them? No. I won't pass the tests. And my home... As much as I don't want to rot here, I can see your point - this is the only place where I'm really needed... Man, I'm confused.}
{177}{}{Come back to your father and tell him you'll stay with him. It will be best for everyone.}
{178}{}{The thing is, you're not ready. So give me some time to think about the answer.}
{179}{}{Okay. I'll do that.}
{180}{}{Great.}
