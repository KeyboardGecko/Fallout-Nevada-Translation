{122}{}{Due to mass desertion, a commission was organized. The commission submitted a report to the head of the garrison.}
{123}{}{"Today an order for testing a line of next-generation signal jammers came in. Tests are scheduled for October 17, 2077. Tests will start at 6:28 p.m. and end at 9:02 p.m. Location: Hawthorne Test Site. All units must be fully operational. To the Engineering Department: Prepare device for testing, conduct unscheduled computer security checks to prevent malfunctions. Transfer the device from the warehouse to the V9 hangar upon receipt of the responsible quartermaster."}
{124}{}{A shipment of 5 containers of a radioactive isotope were delivered to the V9 hangar for temporary storage.}
{125}{}{As it turned out, the military at Hawthorne kept Vault 8 under constant surveillance. They mainly collected data from computer and automated systems and tapped communications. Hawthorne was charged with the responsibility of keeping the Vault safe in case of enemy invasion or natural disasters. The object of surveillance was assigned the highest priority level.}
{126}{}{The military radio station at Lovelock served as a point of contact for communications and surveillance of Vault 8.}
{127}{}{Write down Lovelock's coordinates.}
{128}{}{Hmm. It is where the Cheyenne live. Maybe some of the locals know where this station is located.}
{129}{}{I have been there already.}
