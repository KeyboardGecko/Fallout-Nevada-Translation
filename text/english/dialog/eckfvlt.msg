{100}{}{You see Vault_13.}
{101}{}{You see an administrator, a blogger, a musician, and more.}

{110}{}{Oh, there's nothing better than a glass of radiated beer...}
{111}{}{Hey, bartender, do you accept bitcoins?}
{112}{}{What wouldn't I give for a bowl of Russian dumplings.}
{113}{}{This is not how I pictured post-nuclear post-apocalyptic future.}
{114}{}{Anybody here got a spare spleen?}
{115}{}{Yes, I really find the idea of invisible people funny.}
{116}{}{I'm 179 years old.}
{117}{}{Where's the bathroom here? I need to drop a couple of bombs.}
{118}{}{I used to wear yellow-blue clothes too. It didn't end well.}
{119}{}{Did they kick you out of the vault too?}
{120}{}{Oh, they "sent you on an important mission", huh?}
{121}{}{Don't kid yourself, you just smelled bad or something.}
{122}{}{BRAINS!}
{123}{}{Ha-ha, just kidding.}
{124}{}{To think about it, I used to have a business of my own.}
{125}{}{And all that's left of it is this goddamn disk!}
{126}{}{Imagine, I came to visit some relatives in the US just for a week or so...}
{127}{}{And boom, I get stuck here.}
{128}{}{Why did I even bother paying taxes?}
{129}{}{I thought I'd watch the apocalypse from a comfortable vault at my country house.}
{130}{}{But no.}
{131}{}{I'm stuck here and I'm raving to strangers.}
{132}{}{Hey, maybe you got some weed?}
{133}{}{I knew it.}
{134}{}{Goddamn pothead.}
{135}{}{There's not a single normal person around.}
{136}{}{Stop poking me with that thing!}
