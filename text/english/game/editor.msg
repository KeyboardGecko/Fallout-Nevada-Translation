{1126}{}{You are the legend of the local highway. Men are jealous, women turn their heads on you and children are asking for a ride on your own pickup.}
{1127}{}{The need for speed burns inside you. Any functional transport you consider your property and you will allow no money, no law, nothing in the world to get between you!}
