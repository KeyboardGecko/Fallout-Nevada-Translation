SLASH'S STORY:

Slash's exceptional 
physical abilities 
and rowdy temper 
predestined him to 
a life of brawling. 
He always solved any 
problem by force. 
Perhaps that was the 
reason he was chosen 
to go outside. Everyone 
is tired of him, and no 
doubt he could hold his 
own in the wasteland 
like no one else, so 
why not let him go?
