MORGAN'S STORY:

Morgan is a man of 
incredible perception, 
agility and a bad 
reputation among the 
security services of 
his home vault. His 
nimble fingers and 
acrobatic skills, as 
well as his extensive 
knowledge of local
surroundings, which 
he "borrowed" from the 
Vault Archives network, 
will now help him on his 
long-distance journeys.
