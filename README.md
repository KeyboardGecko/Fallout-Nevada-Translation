# Fallout-Nevada-Translation
Another cleanup of a great mod.

Changelog:
-The story is slightly changed to be more cohesive. (Let's be honest, it was not very consistent. Now it's solid and you can enjoy it, so please do.)
-Some dialogues are overhauled to make more sense
-Some redactory work (A LOT OF IT)

The patch is on the way.
Contribution is encouraged.
