# Fallout-Nevada-Translation
Another cleanup of a great mod. Completed 08.11.2021.

Applicable for "Fallout Nevada Extended Edition" by Pyran (http://www.mediafire.com/file/nqfrkb5fllbpqx4/Fallout_Nevada_Mod_Us.exe/file)
Sometimes Pyran updates the translation, sometimes not. The version in the installer may be outdated, but still playable.

To use the latest version:
 - install Fallout Nevada extended edition using the link above
 - go to the mod folder inside fallout 2 folder (should be something like "c:\games\fallout 2\Nevada Mod (extended)\)
 - create a folder named "patch002.dat" (c:\games\fallout 2\Nevada Mod (extended)\patch002.dat\)
 - downoad everything from this repo into that created folder. 
 - launch and play.

Any contribution is encouraged.
